<string id="st_marlo_chris_invitation_info">
		<text>My friend, we have been keeping an eye on you and we are impressed. Come see us in Yanov, in the tower north of the train station. We have a proposition for you which you will like.</text>
	</string>

<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_0">
		<text>Yo, what's up?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_1">
		<text>I got your message. What do you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_2">
		<text>Nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_3">
		<text>Ah, you're the Stalker who disabled the Brainscorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_4">
		<text>I am, what is it to you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_41">
		<text>I wouldn't stand here today without the help of xcvb, NLTP-Ashes, GhenTuong, RavenAscendant, igigog and demonized.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_42">
		<text>I appreciate this. Now back to the question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_5">
		<text>Who is asking?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_6">
		<text>Me and my man Chris over there followed your work, and we are fans of your work ethic. We want to propose a collab.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_7">
		<text>Not of the trusting kind are you? Don’t worry, I get you, distrust makes you live longer.
		\n \nKnow what? Have a drink on us in the station and ask about Marlo Stanfield and Chris Partlow - people will fill you in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_8">
		<text>A collab? What is the goal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_9">
		<text>The goal is money and power of course - what else is there to be wanted? The way to achieve it? That's the juicy part.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_10">
		<text>I've never heard of you - why should we work together?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_start_dialog_11">
		<text>Haven't heard of me - yet - you mean. Don't worry, that will change.

<string id="chris_partlow_start_dialog_0">
		<text>Yo, talk to my man Marlo first.</text>

<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_0">
		<text>Do you know some Stalkers by the name of “Marlo Stanfield” and “Chris Partlow”?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_1">
		<text>I do... some serious guys, made a name for themselves two years ago. Violent guys too - and that means something here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_2">
		<text>Can you be more specific about them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_3">
		<text>I only saw them a couple of times when they passed through so I didn't have any close dealings with them, but I heard some stories. I assume that 
		they started off like normal guys - bribed their way past the checkpoint and started to do some minor work here and there. The first time their name rang out was two years ago, some bandits were making trouble in Zaton and 
		Sidorovich recruited them amongst others to put them back in place. Story goes that there was a traitor amongst the group which lead them into an ambush - those who weren't killed were taken as hostage, among them Marlo and Chris. 
		The problem was, they didn't have money on the side to pay off the ransom money - so they send word to Sidorovich to pay the ransom with their mission wage. Well you know Sidorovich - of course he refused.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_4">
		<text>Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_5">
		<text>Of course.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_6">
		<text>Officially he said that he doesn't make deals with bandits. But lowkey, he figured if the bandits killed them, he wouldn't have to pay at all. In the end Marlo and Chris were left for dead. 
		But luck was on their side: one evening they managed to break free and to flee, and as you can imagine the story doesn't end here. Marlo and Chris swore revenge: they returned and exerted terrible vengeance! 
		People say that their former jailors were horribly mutilated and each one had carved on his forehead: "Marlo doesn't forget". </text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_7">
		<text>I see you know Sidorovich. \n \nIn the end Marlo and Chris were left for dead.

	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_8">
		<text>And since then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hawaiian_about_marlo_9">
		<text>Well this episode made quite a furor back in the days! They became prime muscle: you needed an escort? Marlo and Chris. Someone was bothering you? 
		Marlo and Chris. Someone didn't pay their debt? Marlo and Chris. \n \nI don't know why you're asking, but my advise: don't fuck with them.</text>
	</string>


<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_0">
		<text>I asked around about you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_2">
		<text>And, did you like what you were hearing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_3">
		<text>Depends. What is your proposition?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_4">
		<text>Not really, you sound like brutes. But tell me nevertheless.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_5">
		<text>We are not that different you and us. We are always working for someone else and his pockets - yes we get paid but in the end it's them who are profiting from our work, it's them who gain in influence and importance. 
			If you're someone's dog - you'll always be a dog. A fierce dog maybe, even a feared one, but there's no respect for the dog himself - only for the dog's owner. I don't know about you, but I've had enough. That's the reason why we propose you a joint-venture. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_6">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_7">
		<text>I've got no problems with working for other people.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_71">
		<text>You...??? \n \nEhm alright, maybe this will change your mind. First, how do you feel about Sidorovich?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_8">
		<text>Aight. First, how do you feel about Sidorovich?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_9">
		<text>Sidorovich? Fuck that greedy pig – the guy got rich by scamming rookies and leeching off the misery in the Zone!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_10">
		<text>Sidorovich? I like him, he's my mentor. Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_11">
		<text>Very well. So I believe you will not have any qualms with what I'm about to propose: \n \nFor too long Sidorovich monopolised trade in the Zone! But he has become complacent and the gip of his fat hand becomes weaker and the control will slip out of his hand. We are not only going to put a stop to that - we are taking over his business! 
		\n \nSo this is my proposition: Chris, you and me, we form a partnership on equal terms and together we fuck Sidorovich out of his business in order to become the new power in the Zone. Chris and me already have tied connections here and on the outside - all that we need is a first show of our abilities in order to convince them to bet on us instead of the lame horse.
		Think of it as a start-up! The chess board is already set up and we are playing white. \n \nWhat do you say? Do you want to toil further for them, or do you want to make your own destiny?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_12">
		<text>What? You like him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_13">
		<text>This sounds very interesting, but can you tell me more about your plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_14">
		<text>I need some time to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_15">
		<text>This sounds like madness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_16">
		<text>Sidorovich will never give up his business.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_17">
		<text>Alright, count me in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_18">
		<text>Thanks for considering me, but I don't want anything to do with this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_19">
		<text>I'm afraid that I can't do that. I need to know if you're with us or not - only then will I tell you the plan.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_20">
		<text>I'm afraid that this is not a proposition which affords the luxury to think about - you have to decide now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_21">
		<text>Madness? No. Ambitious? Absolutely! In order to win at his game you have to be bold and grab the reins of your own destiny.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_22">
		<text>And we are not about to ask him nicely, but to grab it out of his fat hand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_23">
		<text>I knew you would.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_24">
		<text>Then fuck off and run back to your life as a dog.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_25">
		<text>Yes I do - he has been nothing but a father to me. I'm absolutely loyal to him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_26">
		<text>I'm joking, I hate that greedy fuck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_27">
		<text>Then fuck off and return to your master you bitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_0_28">
		<text>Damn, for a moment you had me believing it. Very well. So I believe you will not have any qualms with what I'm about to propose: \n \nFor too long Sidorovich monopolised trade in the Zone! But he has become complacent and the gip of his fat hand becomes weaker and the control will slip out of his hand. We are not only going to put a stop to that - we are taking over his business!

	</string>
	
<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_0">
		<text>So, can you now tell me the plan?</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_1">
		<text>Of course. In order for the plan to work, we first need to prepare for the confrontation. We only need one thing in order to start: we need funds you see - and gear. Now there are two ways we can go about this: the first one would be to pay the gold price. 
		Now that would be quite expensive - we estimate 100.000 for each of us three. I have to tell you, I'm not a big fan of that option. \n \nThe second one is my favourite: we rip it off the mercenaries!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_2">
		<text>Rip off the mercenaries? How do you want to do that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_3">
		<text>We have been observing them for quite some time now. You know their base in Zaton? Well it can function quite autonomously, but every once in a moon they too need to be resupplied - and this resupply has to come from their main base. 
			We figured out their protocol for supplying their base in Zaton. You see, the mercenaries are not your basic gopnik, they are highly organised! Only few people have the necessary clearance to use the organisation channels, and we arleady managed to get make a copy of a PDA with access to them.
			The problem is, they have an extra layer of security - they heavily use encryption and they change the key each time one of their devices have been compromised. So in order to be warned in advance when they make they resupply their base, we need the decryption key without their knowledge. 
			\n \nNow we come to the juicy part: if they want to change the key they cannot send it over the channels - they have to do it physically. So they send a courrier who brings the encryption key in person to their base in Zaton. That's when we strike! We intercept the key, make a copy and then deliver it to them. That way we will know when the next resupply is scheduled!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_4">
		<text>How do we trigger the encryption key delivery procedure? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_5">
		<text>We need to steal one of the devices with the necessary security clearance. They will no longer use the old encryption key out of fear that their conversations are not private anymore! We already have our victim! Chris can tell you the details of this stage!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_6">
		<text>How do we intercept the key without them noticing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_7">
		<text>A friend will tell us when the courrier sets off! He will pass through Yanov, that's the moment we will strike. When you have the key, you'll bring it to us and Chris will make a copy. After that comes a tricky play: you'll have to disguise yourself as a mercenary and make the delivery! Make sure you find a mercenary outfit before that stage! \n \nAfter delivering the encryption key, we can listen in on their conversations. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_8">
		<text>Won't they be suspicious if the courrier never makes it back to the main base?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_9">
		<text>I see you're a sharp one. Don't worry about it, the Zone is a dangerous place. While you're making the delivery, I'll have my guys snatch the body of the courrier and drop in off somewhere where danger is abundant. It will look like he died on his way back - and they won't care as long as it happend after he delivered the key.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_10">
		<text>Why all this hazzle? Can we not simply have spies looking out for signs of an imminent resupply?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_11">
		<text>You see, the mercenaries have this nasty habit of doing it during the night - exactly to prefent such a thing. We need to know it in advance: without our ears in the channel, we won't know in advance where and when the transfer would take place and it would be impossible to organise an interception.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_12">
		<text>Why do we need the supplies so much?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_13">
		<text>The next stage in our plan is quite... resource intensive. Believe me, we need these supplies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_14">
		<text>What is the next stage? After we have the necessary supplies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_15">
		<text>I'm afraid I cannot tell you yet - see, I like you, but I need to know that you're 100% in this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_16">
		<text>Alright, how do we get started?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_1_17">
		<text>If you want to do it the viking way, talk to Chris. He will coordinate this stage. If you prefer to make your money work, you can always talk to me - I'll make the necessary arrangments.</text>
	</string>

<string id="marlo_stanfield_2_0">
		<text>Can you tell me the plan again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_2_16">
		<text>Thanks, that all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_2_17">
		<text>No problem.</text>
	</string>


---- Quest 1 -----
<string id="chris_partlow_1_0">
		<text>How do we get started?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_1">
		<text>Your target is an officer called "Harald Virtanen". He is stationed at the Zaton Waste Processing Station: you have to kill him and steal his PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_2">
		<text>How should I do that? There are at least a dozen of heavily armed mercenaries stationed at that place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_3">
		<text>Don't worry - we already have a plan. It's no coincidence that Harald is our target - it seems that the guy is an alcoholic and sneaks out during night to get his buzz, the perfect time to strike!
	His favourite drinking spot is a garage in the south east corner of the compound. The plan is thus easy: sneak up on him and kill him - if you're lucky the patrols won't notice. 
	If they do, well grab his PDA and run - but whatever you do, don't kill the other mercenaries! We need them alive! And a word of warning, if you try to disguise yourself as a mercenary, don't! They won't be fooled twice.
	While you're at it - if you still haven't found a mercenary outfit, maybe you can also "borrow" his - he won't need it anymore.
	\n \nAre you ready?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_4">
		<text>Yes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_5">
		<text>No, I will need some time preparing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_6">
		<text>Alright - remember to take his PDA or else everything will be for nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_7">
		<text>Alright - make your preparations.</text>
	</string>

<string id="chris_partlow_2_0">
		<text>I got the PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_2_1">
		<text>Well done! Now we have to wait - I will send you a message when they are doing their move. In the meantime take a rest and get ready for the next stage: repair your costume and stock up on ammo. Here, I managed to get you a repair kit for a light outfit and a gun.</text>
	</string>


<string id="zaton_mercenary_1_start_dialog_0">
		<text>What do you want? Can't you see I'm occupied?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zaton_mercenary_1_start_dialog_1">
			<text>Marlo and Chris send their greetings.</text>

--- Quest 2 part 1 ----
<string id="st_chris_key_interception_info">
		<text>Chris Partlow: My man - the courriers are getting ready to depart. Come see me now!</text>

		<text>Jan Baran: Urgent Stalker ambushed usweareattackkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk</text>
	</string>

<string id="chris_partlow_3_0">
		<text>Are the courriers on their way?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_1">
		<text>They are: they left their base yesterday and travelled from Limansk to Yanov using their secret path. They should arrive soon and will look for a place to camp overnight - that's when you will strike.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_2">
		<text>Do you know where they will camp?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_3">
		<text>No, we were not able to find out their plans. It should be somewhere close to where their path emerges, somewhere around the Bandit camp in the South-West. It won't be in the open, so look for any buildings or structures giving shelter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_4">
		<text>Why don't they stay at the bandit camp over night?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_5">
		<text>Would you sleep with a dozen gopniks around you? That's unnecessary trouble - you don't know if you're going to wake up with all your money - or teeths.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_3_6">
		<text>Alright - I will be on my way then.</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="chris_partlow_4_0">
		<text>Yo Chris, I got the USB. They were making camp in the tunnel south of here. Here take the USB and make a copy!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_4_1">
		<text>Excellent work! Alright, let me make a copy \n \n...\n \nHere, take the USB. Now deliver it to an officer called "Aivar Kuusk". He should be somwhere inside the Waste Processing Station. Take this broken PDA too - if they ask you why you didn't write show it to them.\n \n
		Don't forget your Mercenary suit! Remember: no stupid movement like running or jumping - and don't wave your weapon around! I hope your suit and helmet are repaired - and don't forget to take a weapon with you which is used by these assholes. Go in, deliver the USB and get out. We will take care of the corpses. </text>

		<text>What do you want? Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zaton_mercenary_2_start_dialog_1">
			<text>I am the courrier - I bring you your USB stick with the encryption and decryption key for this section.</text>

<string id="chris_partlow_5_0">
		<text>I got your message about the handover.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_5_1">
		<text>Yeah, the mercenaries from Dead City are about to arrive. They'll set up camp at the car fortress on the other side of the street - to the east from here. The others from Zaton are also on their way so you'll have to act fast.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_5_2">
		<text>Alright. What's the plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_5_3">
		<text>I gathered some of our guys - they are waiting at the Yanov Station for you. The main guy is Monk - find him and then proceed to the assault. I'll keep an eye on you from here and warn you if the Mercenaries from Zaton are getting close. There should be six supply crates - bring them to me, and we are golden. Good luck - give those assholes hell!</text>
	</string>

<string id="st_chris_asset_interception_info_2">
		<text>Chris Partlow: Watch out, I see a squad of Mercenaries to the north of you! That's the guys from Zaton - take a defensive position!</text>

	</string>	
	<string id="chris_partlow_6_7">
		<text>Excellent work! You're a real soldier - Marlo agrees. Have a rest, and if you're ready come see Marlo - he'll tell you about the next stage. [Next missions in a future update]</text>

----Stage 4----
---Takeover---
--Marlo--

<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_0">
		<text>So, what is the next stage in your plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_1">
		<text>Now my friend we take over the Skadovsk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_2">
		<text>The Skadovsk? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_3">
		<text>The Skadovsk is the key to the north - most Loners here sell and buy from Beard and Owl. Until now Sidorovich and Beard had a deal: Beard, and with him the Skadovsk, trade with Sidorovich - he gets the artifacts and they get weapons, money and men in exchange.
	If we own the Skadovsk, the north belongs to us - and Sidorovich will lose a huge source of financial revenues thus weakening his position. And what is most important - it's ripe for the taking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_4">
		<text>How do you plan to take it over?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_5">
		<text>You see, Beard is under a lot of pressure - Monolith activities are growing and their raids become more frequent. He can only protect with difficulty the Stalkers there and people are getting restless.
	Sidorovich on the other hands tries to cheap out on support - he only sends the bare minimum citing difficult supply lines as an excuse. 
	If we increase their difficulties, the support for Beard and Sidorovich will drop and we swoop in offering protection and supplies taking the Skadovsk for us - Beard will have no choice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_6">
		<text>How do you know all of this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_7">
		<text>We already made a proposition to Owl to co-op - let's say he's quite enthusiastic about this takeover. He told us about the weak points we can exploit - he's also your main contact partner during this operation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_8">
		<text>How do you plan on increasing the pressure on Beard?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_9">
		<text>Beard mostly relies on two Stalkers for protecting the Skadovsk: Spartacus and Achilles. Both of them are fearsome warriors and they enjoy the popularity and support of many Loners in the north . men who are ready to fight with them.
	If both of them die, Beard will have lost most of his military powerbase and he will be forced to accept our protection. 
\n \nIn the same time, we will increase hostile activity in Zaton through the bandits - we will pay some of them to make trouble in Zaton, thus increasing pressure on Beard to accept our protection.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_10">
		<text>Will killing Spartacus and Achilles not make us extremly unpopular with the Skadovsk?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_11">
		<text>Yes - that is why you cannot kill them outright: you will have to arrange an accident or do it in disguise. We cannot be linked to these assassinations! Talk to Owl for the details, he should have an idea how to get them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_12">
		<text>Isn't the Zone harsh enough, do we now need to kill fellow Loners?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_13">
		<text>Are you a moron? Or some fucking pacifistic idealist? Do you think Sidorovich achieved his influence by asking nicely? Only because you are not able to see the violence does not mean it is not there! 
		The Zone is not a fucking birthday party, it's ride or die here - you have to be willing to fight for your place, because the next motherfucker will not think twice about putting a bullet in your brain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_14">
		<text>Relax, I understand - you're right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_15">
		<text>All I'm saying is that there might be another way. Let me at least try to convince Beard that working with us is better for him and the Skadovsk. Besides - it's also good for business, more men on our side.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_16">
		<text>Maybe you're not so stupid after all. Do you have another question or can we proceed with business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_17">
		<text>You're a fucking moron. \n \n... \n \nFine, but don't fuck it up! It will be harder if they know that we're coming for them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_18">
		<text>Alright, where do we begin?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_19">
		<text>Go see Owl - he will tell you what to do. We'll stay in touch if there is anything coming up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_20">
		<text>Wait, I have a question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_21">
		<text>What is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_22">
		<text>Alright, where do we begin?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_23">
		<text>How should I know? But if you change your mind and want to go with our plan - go see Owl.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_24">
		<text>Alright, I'll head to the Skadovsk now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_25">
		<text>Alright, I'll head to the Skadovsk now.</text>

<string id="achilles_joke_0_0">	
	<text>Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. 
	There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. 
	If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.
	The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.
	However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.
	On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other. \n
The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. \n
The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. \n
Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. \n
The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. \n
The Rabbi pulled out an apple. \n
With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!
Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. 
He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 
'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. 
He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 
'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. 
He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!' \n

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 
'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' 
Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.' 
And then what?' asked a woman. Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'</text>

I know nothing of their exact plans, and what I mean by that, I know nothing about the true size of this conspiracy! I need to know if they have allies, I need to know where they see a weakness of mine! 
For that I need an inside man! \n \nA shame that you told them to fuck off, they won't trust you if you go back now... we need to find a way to get you back into their trust... \n \nAh yes, yes, I know the way! We'll stage a public affront - an humilation so to speak! </text>

<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_1_0">
		<text>What is going on Sidorovich, why the long face?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_1_1">
		<text>Ah, I have got quite the headache at the moment. Take a look at this Goldfish Artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_1_2">
		<text> … </text>
	</string>

<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_0">
		<text>About your artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_1">
		<text>Did you notice something?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_2">
		<text>It is strange, it looks like a Goldfish and it kind of feels like one, but….</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_3">
		<text>But it is a fake! And what a fake! A perfect copy of a Goldfish! Even got the radiation right! I have never seen a copy like this – 
			and believe me, a lot of people tried to fool old Sidorovich or got fooled and tried to pass it on to me. I even considered myself as an expert, able to discern a fake from a real one by sight only... </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_4">
		<text>How did you figure out that it’s a fake? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_5">
		<text>By pure chance! An ecologist recently came in - apparently, he owed some money to the wrong kind of people – you understand – 
			and came here trying to pawn a scientific instrument he nicked from their storage rooms: this Artifact Measurement Instrument. “But why would I need an A.M.I.?” – I asked him “Now a nice detector, that is worth something, but an A.M.I.? I got no use for it, and where would I find a buyer for such a specific tool?”
			Hahaha, I managed to get it from him for 10.000 roubles. “Pawned” of course, but that poor fool will never manage to get out his situation. \n \nSo as soon as he left, I grabbed the first artifact and what did my incredulous eyes witness? A fucking fake! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_6">
		<text>What is an Artifact Measurement Instrument? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_7">
		<text>You don't know what an A.M.I. is? It's an instrument used by the scientists to determine the different properties and their values an artifact possesses! Of course they have much better and precise ones in their labs, but this one is a field version! Quite expensive I might add, and quite rare - although most people won't have any use for it. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_8">
		<text>Maybe the A.M.I is malfunctioning? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_9">
		<text>I also thought that maybe the Ecologist tried to scam me, trying to load off a broken A.M.I., but I immediately tried it on all my other artifacts and for them it show's their correct properties.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_10">
		<text>You not only scammed that desperate Ecologist, but it also turns out it was useful to you! You should give back that poor dude the actual value of his A.M.I., at least enough for him to get out of his debt! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_11">
		<text>What are you talking about? We made a fair deal, I didn't force him to sell it to me - I proposed a price, we bartered a bit and he agreed. Besides, he didn't sell it to me, but pawned it - he can always return and get it back for 12500 roubles. And don't forget that stuff is stolen – he should be happy someone took it off his hands.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_12">
		<text>Why didn't you check the Goldfish with a detector?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_13">
		<text>Do you think I'm new at this business? Do you think me a fool? Of course I checked it with a detector, that's like the most basic step everyone knows! I don’t know how the forger managed, but the detector is reacting normally to the fake Goldfish...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_14">
		<text>Who sold you the Goldfish?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_15">
		<text>That's the question! It came amongst cargo from the north - from where exactly I don't know.</text>
	</string>
	
	
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_116">
		<text>Cargo from the north?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_117">
		<text>Mostly stuff Beard bought and sells through my channels, according to our deal he sells through me, and I provision them with weapons, supplies and men. But </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_118">
		<text>What about Hawaiian and Barkeep?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_119">
		<text>They mostly trade with Freedom and Duty respectively. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_120">
		<text>What about the two guys from the fleamarket?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_121">
		<text>Those assholes refuse doing business with me </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_120">
		<text>Who brought the cargo here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_121">
		<text>[...]</text>
	</string>
	
	
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_16">
		<text>Well, sucks for you - write it off and forget about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_17">
		<text>What? WHAT? No one - I repeat - NO ONE tries to scam Sidorovich! Besides, do you know what would have happened if I would have passed it on without discovering this fake by pure chance? The visit I would receive? The repercussions? The money I would loose? No, no, this doesn't end here... My friend, I propose you a job - a mighty well paying one too! I want you to find out who produced this fake and how it ended up in my hands. What do you say? Don't let your old benefactor hang in such dire circumstances. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_18">
		<text>Alright, but I want some proper money for this. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_19">
		<text>I have to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_20">
		<text>I promise you, you will never be hungry again!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_21">
		<text>Arg, you cruel son of the Zone. Alright, but don't take long! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_22">
		<text>So where do I begin?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_23">
		<text>That's a good question... to be honest, I'm not sure myself. There has to be a network of people trading in shady goods - a sort of Black Market if you will.
			\n \nI have different suspicions: I wouldn't be surprised if these two fuckers from the Flea Market are involved.
			There is no way that all their goods are from a legitimate source - trash diving my ass - I am sure they are fencing for the bandits in Dark Valley. But there is also no way the bandits would be that good at forging...
			\n \nThen there is this guy Snitch - the shadiest guy in the Zone - he usually trades in informations no one should have... maybe he also trades in goods no one should have...
			\n \nWho else? Ah this asshole Owl - I heard some strange things about him: a couple of years ago there was an incident at the Skadovsk between Beard and Sultan. It seemed as if Owl's loyalty was not necessarily on our side, some even 
			say he financed the coup attempt... he is also a good candidate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_24">
		<text>A black market in the Zone? Isn't the whole Zone one huge black market?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_25">
		<text>Sure, but even here there are goods and services your average Stalker would never touch...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_26">
		<text>A black market in the Zone and you're not part of it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_27">
		<text>I resent the implication! I'm a straight businessman! I have a reputation to uphold!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_28">
		<text>Sounds like I will have to do a lot of questioning... and it's quite expensive to get people talking in the Zone. Give me some cash in order to grease their tongues.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_29">
		<text>My friend, why would you need an advance? Make a list of your expenses, and I'll reimburse you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_30">
		<text>Sidorovich, don't try to cheap out on this one. Give me 10.000 roubles for expenses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_31">
		<text>Alright, but don't try to weasle your way out of it later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_32">
		<text>Alright, alright, here you have the money. But try to keep expenses on the lower side. \n \nNow go and find the fucker who did this!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_fake_artifact_2_33">
		<text>Don't worry my friend. \n \nNow go and find the fucker who did this!</text>

		that I could win everzthing back... in the end my debt grew to 20.000 roubles - worse yet the guy is member of a bandit gang and now he threatens to kill me if I don't bring him his money. 
		They're waiting in the old pig farm in Dark Valley for me... I managed to gahther 15.000 roubles by selling all my belongings and some extra, but I don't know from where I should take the remaining 5.000 roubles... </text>

--Quest1 now 3--
	
<string id="butcher_1_start_0">
		<text>You said there was a lost cargo?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_1">
		<text>Yeah - a scientist, Vybegallo, over in Agroprom contacted me because his order got lost in the marshes. A substantial food delivery apparently - the small probably attracted a dogs 
		and the delivery guy decided his life was more important than the job and threw the cargo to them in order to distract the pack. Everything happened quite fast, so he doesn't remember the exact size of that pack, but he said there were a shit ton of them, so I guess there should be a dozen.
		\n \n Do you think you can recover the package and deliver it to that scientist?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_2">
		<text>Sure, I’m up for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_3">
		<text>Thanks, but I’m not ready yet.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_start_4">
		<text>Alright. According to his report he got jumped by them near an old construction site. The guy made his way past the Pump Station and kept the village with the water tower to his left, and the village the military sometimes uses to his right. Your job is to recover the package, there is no bounty on the dogs.
	If you found the package, deliver it to Vybegallo, he is somewhere in the Agroprom fabric.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come back later.</text>
	</string>	

<string id="butcher_1_time_0">
		<text>About your lost package.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_time_1">
		<text>Yes, are you ready?</text>
	</string>

<string id="butcher_1_done_0">
		<text>I delivered the package.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Keep the reward money, you deserve it. If you're ready, the snork problem requires some more attention.</text>
	</string>
	
-- Quest 2 --

<string id="butcher_2_start_0">
		<text>Do you have some special jobs for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_1">
		<text>I heard of some of your exploits, you seem like the capable kind… \n \nYou see, Duty pays me to keep the road from Cordon to Rostok free from particularly dangerous mutant threats – the sort the rookies wouldn’t be able to handle. You know, good for business and so on. Luckily the really dangerous mutants are rather rare in these parts. 
		\n \n Most of the times my problems here are rather that packs of animals grow to a threatening number -  and exactly such a problem emerged. A sow gave birth to a litter of piglets a couple of months ago, reports vary on their number. Some say three, others believe to have seen six. 
		Be as it may, I need you to put and end to them before the piglets grow to adult boars – I don’t need to tell you what a problem that would be. So what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_2">
		<text>Consider it done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_start_4">
		<text>That’s the spirit! They inhabit the small wood in the south east, behind the Witches Jelly anomaly. Here take these, they should come in handy! Come see me when they’re dead, I’ll have put some vodka put to the side for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_2_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to take on the boars?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_2_done_0">
		<text>The boars are no more.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have some booze and some food – on the house! And of course, a reward for your troubles. Have a rest and if you want more work – there is something urgent.</text>
	</string>
	
	
-- Quest 3 --

<string id="butcher_3_start_0">
		<text>You said there was an urgent task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_1">
		<text>Indeed. \n \n A group of snorks got lost and wandered over here from Agroprom. This happens sometimes, but in the past it always was one or two who found a way here - this time the reports talk about four! We can't let them dwell there, they pose too large a threat to the rookies. So what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_2">
		<text>They are as good as dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_start_4">
		<text>Alright! They took up residence south west from here,near the southern path to Agroprom... Here take this, they should come in handy! Come see me when they’re dead, we'll raise a glass to your deeds!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_3_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to take on the snorks?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_3_done_0">
		<text>The snorks are dead.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have a drink and some food. Here, have a smoke too. And of course, a reward for your troubles. Have a rest and come see me, we have to do something about this snork problem.</text>
	</string>	
	
-- Quest 4 --

<string id="butcher_4_start_0">
		<text>You said you wanted to talk to me about the snork problem?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_1">
		<text>Yes. \n \nYou see, this snork incursion worries me. It sometimes happend in the past, but never in these numbers! I've been thinking, probably the snork population in Agroprom grew too much and that's the reason why they come over in larger numbers now... Can you have a look and if my suspicion is right - cull them? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_2">
		<text>I will take a look.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_start_4">
		<text>Alright! Don't go alone, Ilya over there will accompany you - fear not he's a capable fighter. Travel over to Agroprom, if my suspicions are true, they should be somewhere between the southern and the northern path to Garbage. 
		There is a hill there, chances are good that's where you'll find them. Take this, you will need it. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_4_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to cull the snork population?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_4_done_0">
		<text>The snorks are dead.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have a drink and a bite. So tell me, how is the snork situation over there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_done_2">
		<text>You were right, we killed at least ten snorks! It was a massacre, I'm glad we made it out alive!</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="butcher_4_done_3">
		<text>Ten of these pieces of shit? Fuck... good that I send both you and Ilya to take care of the problem... We will have to keep an eye on this situation - this is very strange. 
		\n \nThanks for your help! Take a rest, and if you feel able to do some work again, go meet Aspirin, the Duty medic. He contacted me, seems they need some discrete help. </text>

--- Ilya Muromets ---
<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello Stalker, how can I help you?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, who are you?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_2">
		<text>I'm Ilya Muromets, but you can call me Ilya. I'm an old friend of Butcher. </text>
	</string>	

<string id="ilya_muromets_1_0">
		<text>Are you ready to go hunt some snorks?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_1_1">
		<text>Yeah, butcher told me to give you a hand. Lead the way, I'm behind you.</text>
	</string>

	
--- Hunter Duty ---	
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_0">
		<text>Butcher told me you might have a job for me.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_1">
		<text>Ah right! Thanks for coming.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_2">
		<text>No problem, how can I help?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_3">
		<text>Right. To make it short, the boys here have some trouble on their hands. Voronin recently went to a meeting with Sakharov and Kuznetsov to discuss some general matters. During that meeting, Sakharov asked Voronin to help them by clearing the Bloodsucker Village, a proposition Kuznetsov apparently laughed at, saying Duty wasn't able to manage that and he proposed the help of his soldiers instead.
			Voronin took that very badly, and started to boast about our boys capabilities. Nothing bad at defending the honour of our soldiers, but he lost any touch to reality and promised Sakharov to clear out the Bloodsucker Village for them. Problem is, he wants to do it overnight in order for the Ecologists to show up in the morning and find a safe village... Over fucking night! Can you imagine? 
		He wants to show off in front of the military, you understand - and this asshole doesn't care about the fact that some of them won't survive the night. \n \nOf course the boys are less than enthusiastic to lose their lifes for the General's ego, they are soldiers after all, no Spetsnaz.
		So they came to me, and I promised to see what I can do - I thought of Butcher and asked if he couldn't send us an experiencied hunter who is up to the job. Of course you need to be discrete, Vornonin can't know anything about this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_4">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_5">
		<text>Clearing out the Bloodsucker Village during night? That's suicide!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_6">
		<text>"We are not to reason why, we are but to do and die." Orders are orders, I don't condone insubordination!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_7">
		<text>I'm glad to hear that, it is always nice to talk to professionals. Of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. So you're in?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_8">
		<text>Yes it's tough, but think about it - if someone can do it, it's certainly you! Butcher told me about your skills hunting mutants - that's more than I can say about our boys. Of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. Will you help us? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_9">
		<text>I understand the need for a soldier to follow orders of his superiors, but this is objectively not a sane mission! These are actual people being send for a mission they haven't trained for! Think of it! You on the other hand have experience in these matters, 
		at least Butcher told me that you are skilled in hunting mutants. And of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. So you're in?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_10">
		<text>Alright, I will do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_11">
		<text>I can do it, but I want Voronin to know it was me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_12">
		<text>I need some time to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_13">
		<text>No way, they can do it themselves!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_14">
		<text>God bless you. Come see me the night you want to do it, I'll give you the nightvision device and warn the boys they should pretend to leave for the raid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_15">
		<text>That's not possible, Voronin wants it to be the guys designated by him. Can you not do it for them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_16">
		<text>Alright, but please don't take too long, Voronin grows impatient.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_17">
		<text>Are you sure? Think about it, the guys would really appreciate it!</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_time_0">
		<text>About the Bloodsucker Village.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_time_1">
		<text>Yeah? Are you up to it?</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_1">
		<text>Yeah? Did you change your mind?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_13">
		<text>I decided, I will certainly not do it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_17">
		<text>*Sigh* A shame, I had high hopes for you, but alright... I'll ask Butcher if he can send me someone else...</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_0">
		<text>About the Bloodsucker Village.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_1">
		<text>Yes, what about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_2">
		<text>I am ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_3">
		<text>I am ready.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_4">
		<text>I am not ready yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_5">
		<text>Good to hear that, come see me this night before you set off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_6">
		<text>Perfect. Here is your nightvision device - I also packed some batteries so that you won't find yourself in the middle of night without juice. Take these medics too, hopefully you won't need them, but better safe than sorry.
		You have to be back in six hours, before the Ecologists will set off! Good hunting Stalker, and thanks for helping us out!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_7">
		<text>Alright, come see me when you are.</text>
	</string>	

<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_0">
		<text>What happend in the Bloodsucker Village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_1">
		<text>You ratted us out, that's was happened. And afterwards, our fears became true, the boys were unprepared for what waited for them in that cursed village.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_2">
		<text>I believe in following orders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_3">
		<text>FINISH DIALOG</text>
	</string>	


<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_0">
		<text>I need to tell you something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_1">
		<text>What are you waiting for, speak up!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_2">
		<text>Your men tried to pay me to clear the Bloodsucker village for them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_3">
		<text>Nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_4">
		<text>What? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_5">
		<text>Then stop wasting my time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_6">
		<text>They are afraid to do it - they say that they are not trained for such a night mission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_7">
		<text>These cowards... I will beat bravery into them - thanks for telling me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_8">
		<text>It was me who cleared the Bloodsucker Village - your men payed me to do the job in their stead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_9">
		<text>What? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_10">
		<text>They were too afraid to do it - they said that they are not trained for such a night mission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_11">
		<text>These cowards... I will beat bravery into them - thanks for telling me! 
		Here have a "fee" to keep your mouth shut, we can't have this disgrace be known in the Zone.</text>
	</string>

<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_0">
		<text>You wanted to see me?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_1">
		<text>Yes... I'm afraid that the mission failed. Of the four men I send only one made it back - badly wounded and out of his mind. 
				We barely got anything out of him, but it seems that it went to shit the moment they set foot into that Village.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_2">
		<text>What happened?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_3">
		<text>Artyom wasn't able to give a full report...  from what I understood, they didn’t follow protocol and separated which resulted in a mission failure. 
		He's with Aspirin at the moment, maybe you can get something out of him. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_4">
		<text>What do you want me to do about the situation?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_5">
		<text>No one can know about this failure and my men refuse to go back to that Village during night. 
			I need someone to sneak into the village during night and swap the fallen men's Duty patch with Mercenary ones... </text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_6">
		<text>What? Are you fucking kidding me?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_7">
		<text>Understandable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_8">
		<text>Not at all, this is vital for the reputation of Duty - we can not be allowed to show weakness!</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_9">
		<text>I'm glad that we are on the same page - the reputation of Duty is after all paramount.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_10">
		<text>Can you not simply recover their bodies?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_11">
		<text>Out of question! That would draw too much attention to the failure - I cannot allow it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_111">
		<text>But these man died in the line of duty! You have to recover them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_112">
		<text>These men knew for what they signed up. Besides, the reputation of Duty is larger than the memory of a few men.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_12">
		<text>Why Mercenary patches?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_13">
		<text>Isn't it obvious? To make it look as if some Mercenaries dressed as Duty soldiers in order to bypass Rostok without unnecessary attention, but got caught in the Bloodsucker Village. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_14">
		<text>Alright, I will help you clean up the evidence.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_15">
		<text>I have to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_16">
		<text>I don't want to be involved in this.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_17">
		<text>Good. Prepare for the mission and come see me during the night before you set off.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_18">
		<text>Then do it fast, the more time passes the more people will notice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_19">
		<text>Are you sure? I'm ready to pay a good price for this, let's say 20.000 roubles?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_20">
		<text>For that price I can do it.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_21">
		<text>No forget it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_22">
		<text>Good. Prepare for the mission and come see me during the night before you set off.</text>

		<text>Yes?</text>

		<text>I am ready. Tell me about the details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_1_3">
		<text>Perfect. The mission is rather simple, you find the bodies of Vadim, Sergey and Sasha and replace their Duty patch with these ones. But be careful to finsih the job before sunrise, we can't have anyone seeing you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_1_4">
		<text>I need some more time.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_1_6">

<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_0">
		<text>You said you have a job offer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_1">
		<text>Yes - the boys want to get vengeance on these Bloodsuckers and considering that you have... 
	experience with that Village, they would like you to join them on their expedition.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_2">
		<text>So you're not taking it badly that I told Voronin and accepted his job?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_3">
		<text>Well... obviously that was not very cool of you - we could have hired someone else who would have done it instead of you.
	But... I - We understand that the Zone is not very conductive for morals and that people like you are here for... their personal gains.
	Water under the Bridge, you didn't kill Sasha, Sergey and Vadim, these fucking Bloodsuckers did it... now we would like to hire you for payback. 
	A lot of money Stalker, the boys didn't clutch their wallets in order to get payback.</text>

		<text>No bad feelings about Artyom?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_5">
		<text>Artyom, yes, that was - to be frank - quite stupid of you to give him that much morphine. Poor Artyom... He didn't deserve to die like this.

		<text>No night raid needed Stalker, the plan is quite different. We bought all the explosives we could get our hands on, and we will set them up in different locations of the village showing Bloodsucker activity.
		When they creep out during the night, we will blow them up like firework!</text>

	<string id="vybegallo_start_8">
		<text>Mon cher, why this attitude? I'm a scientist, a man dedicated to science! I need a sample from a Pseudogiant - for strictly scientific reasons of course! For the sake of progress, mon cher.

	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_5">
		<text>Alright… Please tell me if you know something about what he is up to. He himself is not dangerous, but his scientific research on the other hand… My advice to you, don’t get caught up in his dealings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_6">
		<text>He asked me to help him with his science experiment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_7">
		<text>He asked you for help? No offence, but you don’t look like a lab assistant. Why would Vybegallo need a Stalker?</text>

		<text>He asked me to find some artifact for him.</text>

		<text>An artifact? This seems unusual for him, but maybe he finally found a normal research topic…</text>

	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_11">
		<text>What? This is horrible!!! \n \n… \n \nYou see, years ago Vybegallo got into his head to create the “ideal man” – or the “fully satisfied man” as he calls it, but his experiments were one disaster after another. I'm not talking about the ethical aspects, my god, although they are bad enough. His first version, the fully unsatisfied man, was a miserable creature who dwindled away under our very eyes... But Vybegallo was not discouraged and continued his experiments.
		\n \nAfter one especially egregious attempt which nearly cost the life of half his department, his research institute kicked him out. But Vybegallo somehow managed to pull some strings and wound up here! I’m afraid he didn’t give up on this experiment… Who knows what he will unleash?  \n \nI implore you, don’t help him out! \n \n No this is not enough, here take this order to him and make him understand that he has to cease any dangerous experiments immediately. I don’t know how much he promised you, I can’t put much on the table at the moment, but I will find some reward. \n\nWill you help us out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_12">
		<text>Sure, I will deliver the letter and not help him out any further.</text>

		<text>I need some money Sidorovich, do you have a better paying job to offer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_1">
		<text>You’re in luck, I’m indeed hiring some guns at the moment… I’m putting together a team to take back the railway bridge crossing. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_2">
		<text>What happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_3">
		<text>The bandits recently reinforced that crossing and are asking for quite a high bribe to let people pass – very bad for business. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_4">
		<text>An assault? What’s the plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_5">
		<text>We will effectuate a pincer movement. Cold send a squad over to help out, under the leadership of a certain “Rodion Oslyabya”, they should arrive soon at the northern farm. 
		My team will gather at the mill under the leadership of Alexander Peresvet. \n\nYou will take on the role of messenger – you’ll first need to bypass the railway bridge to make contact with Rodion and check if they are ready for the assault. 
		If they are ready, you return to the Mill where Rodion will wait. If everyone is in place, tell Rodion that the assault can begin. \n\nAny questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_6">
		<text>Why do I need to make contact in person. Can’t we use the PDA messenger to communicate with the Clear Sky squad?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_7">
		<text>Are you aware that to render PDA communication secure is a complicated procedure? You would have to exchange encryption and decryption keys manually - a huge hazzle. 
		Surprise is primordial in this assault – the PDA stays silent until the very moment the assault begins. \n\nAny other questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_8">
		<text>How do I bypass the railway bridge unseen?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_9">
		<text>You really are a rookie… well there is a small underway to the west of the bridge and the mill. It’s small, badly lit and a little dangerous but will suit our needs perfectly. \n\nAny other questions?</text>

		<text>How much are you willing to pay?</text>

		<text>Can you tell me the plan again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_15">
		<text>What about the vehicle park to the east of the bridge? Won’t the bandits come in reinforcement?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_16">
		<text>That is very possible, and the reason why the assault has to be over as quick as possible. If the bandits send reinforcement, you beat them off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_17">
		<text>Can we not make a diversionary attack on the vehicle park?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_18">
		<text>I like that idea, but we don’t have enough manpower to make such an attack. The plan stays, we overwhelm the bridge defences and dig in our heels if they send reinforcement.</text>

<string id="chris_partlow_1_0">
		<text>How do we get started?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_1">
		<text>Your target is an officer called "Harald Virtanen". He is stationed at the Zaton Waste Processing Station: you have to kill him and steal his PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_2">
		<text>How should I do that? There are at least a dozen of heavily armed mercenaries stationed at that place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="chris_partlow_1_3">
		<text>Don't worry - we already have a plan. It's no coincidence that Harald is our target - it seems that the guy is an alcoholic and sneaks out during night to get his buzz.
	His favourite drinking spot is a garage in the south east corner of the compound. Sneak up on him and kill him - remember to take his PDA too! That will trigger the procedure.
	And while you're at it - if you still haven't found a mercenary outfit, maybe you can also "borrow" his - he won't need it anymore.

	<string id="chris_partlow_3_1">

----Stage 4----
---Takeover---
--Marlo--

<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_0">
		<text>So, what is the next stage in your plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_1">
		<text>Now my friend we take over the Skadovsk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_2">
		<text>The Skadovsk? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_3">
		<text>The Skadovsk is the key to the north - most Loners here sell and buy from Beard and Owl. Until now Sidorovich and Beard had a deal: Beard, and with him the Skadovsk, trade with Sidorovich - he gets the artifacts and they get weapons, money and men in exchange.
	If we own the Skadovsk, the north belongs to us - and Sidorovich will lose a huge source of financial revenues thus weakening his position. And what is most important - it's ripe for the taking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_4">
		<text>How do you plan to take it over?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_5">
		<text>You see, Beard is under a lot of pressure - Monolith activities are growing and their raids become more frequent. He can only protect with difficulty the Stalkers there and people are getting restless.
	Sidorovich on the other hands tries to cheap out on support - he only sends the bare minimum citing difficult supply lines as an excuse. 
	If we increase their difficulties, the support for Beard and Sidorovich will drop and we swoop in offering protection and supplies taking the Skadovsk for us - Beard will have no choice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_6">
		<text>How do you know all of this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_7">
		<text>We already made a proposition to Owl to co-op - let's say he's quite enthusiastic about this takeover. He told us about the weak points we can exploit - he's also your main contact partner during this operation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_8">
		<text>How do you plan on increasing the pressure on Beard?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_9">
		<text>Beard mostly relies on two Stalkers for protecting the Skadovsk: Spartacus and Achilles. Both of them are fearsome warriors and they enjoy the popularity and support of many Loners in the north . men who are ready to fight with them.
	If both of them die, Beard will have lost most of his military powerbase and he will be forced to accept our protection. 
\n \nIn the same time, we will increase hostile activity in Zaton through the bandits - we will pay some of them to make trouble in Zaton, thus increasing pressure on Beard to accept our protection.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_10">
		<text>Will killing Spartacus and Achilles not make us extremly unpopular with the Skadovsk?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_11">
		<text>Yes - that is why you cannot kill them outright: you will have to arrange an accident or do it in disguise. We cannot be linked to these assassinations! Talk to Owl for the details, he should have an idea how to get them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_12">
		<text>Isn't the Zone harsh enough, do we now need to kill fellow Loners?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_13">
		<text>Are you a moron? Or some fucking pacifistic idealist? Do you think Sidorovich achieved his influence by asking nicely? Only because you are not able to see the violence does not mean it is not there! 
		The Zone is not a fucking birthday party, it's ride or die here - you have to be willing to fight for your place, because the next motherfucker will not think twice about putting a bullet in your brain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_14">
		<text>Relax, I understand - you're right.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_15">
		<text>All I'm saying is that there might be another way. Let me at least try to convince Beard that working with us is better for him and the Skadovsk. Besides - it's also good for business, more men on our side.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_16">
		<text>Maybe you're not so stupid after all. Do you have another question or can we proceed with business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_17">
		<text>You're a fucking moron. \n \n... \n \nFine, but don't fuck it up! It will be harder if they know that we're coming for them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_18">
		<text>Alright, where do we begin?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_19">
		<text>Go see Owl - he will tell you what to do. We'll stay in touch if there is anything coming up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_20">
		<text>Wait, I have a question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_21">
		<text>What is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_22">
		<text>Alright, where do we begin?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_23">
		<text>How should I know? But if you change your mind and want to go with our plan - go see Owl.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marlo_stanfield_11_24">
		<text>Alright, I'll head to the Skadovsk now.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Here have some meat to chase the burn.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_13">
		<text>Thanks. So tell me, what happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_14">
		<text>You won't believe it! Yesterday I was drinking with the boys and we played some cards. My luck turned bad and I lost all my money to Andrey.
	So, this morning I set out in order to make my money back - I figured if I managed to hunt some Flesh or Boars, I could sell their parts for some good money. I set off a bit later int the morning, but
	the sun was heavy, so I decided to take a short rest in the shadow of the old Church: I had a few bites and some sips of Vodka - to fight my headache, you understand?
	Suddenly I heard some guys talking behind the wall,  what a foul language, you can't imagine! Fuck, I thought, tongues like this only grow on these Renegade Gopniks,
	so I took my feet into my hands and ran away to the north. Luckily they didn't see me, so my skin was safe... might have forgotten my bottle though now that I think of it.
	Fuck it! I bypassed the cemetery and made my way to the pond -
	I figured that maybe I might catch some of these pigs watering. Aah, my friend, my intuition was right, there were two pigs taking a rest on the shore. 
	I snuck up and BAM - shot and missed. My hands were probably still shaky from yesterday evening... doesn't matter! The two pigs squeal up taking off in the direction of the burned farmstead. 
	I lunch myself in pursuit, but I gave those two such a fright that one run straight into the flame anomaly! The pillar engulfed him immediatly, roasting him on the spot.
	I cursed the heavens, impossible to make money of that pile of ashes now I thought. But then I noticed it... the pig probably kicked a Flame while running through the anomaly,
	and the artifact landed outside, ripe for the taking! Can you imagine it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_15">
		<text>Incredible! What luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_16">

	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_17">

	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_18">
		<text>Ah my friend, I quite enjoy drinking with you! Let's have another one, to friendship!</text>

		<text>I like drinking with you too! To friendship!</text>

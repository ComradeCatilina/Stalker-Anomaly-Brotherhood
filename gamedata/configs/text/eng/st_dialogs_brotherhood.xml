--Quest1 now 3--
	
<string id="butcher_1_start_0">
		<text>You said there was a lost cargo?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_1">
		<text>Yeah - a scientist, Vybegallo, over in Agroprom contacted me because his order got lost in the marshes. A substantial food delivery apparently - the small probably attracted a dogs 
		and the delivery guy decided his life was more important than the job and threw the cargo to them in order to distract the pack. Everything happened quite fast, so he doesn't remember the exact size of that pack, but he said there were a shit ton of them, so I guess there should be a dozen.
		\n \n Do you think you can recover the package and deliver it to that scientist?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_2">
		<text>Sure, I’m up for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_3">
		<text>Thanks, but I’m not ready yet.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_start_4">
		<text>Alright. According to his report he got jumped by them near an old construction site. The guy made his way past the Pump Station and kept the village with the water tower to his left, and the village the military sometimes uses to his right. Your job is to recover the package, there is no bounty on the dogs.
	If you found the package, deliver it to Vybegallo, he is somewhere in the Agroprom fabric.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_1_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come back later.</text>
	</string>	

<string id="butcher_1_time_0">
		<text>About your lost package.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_time_1">
		<text>Yes, are you ready?</text>
	</string>

<string id="butcher_1_done_0">
		<text>I delivered the package.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_1_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Keep the reward money, you deserve it. If you're ready, the snork problem requires some more attention.</text>
	</string>
	
-- Quest 2 --

<string id="butcher_2_start_0">
		<text>Do you have some special jobs for me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_1">
		<text>I heard of some of your exploits, you seem like the capable kind… \n \nYou see, Duty pays me to keep the road from Cordon to Rostok free from particularly dangerous mutant threats – the sort the rookies wouldn’t be able to handle. You know, good for business and so on. Luckily the really dangerous mutants are rather rare in these parts. 
		\n \n Most of the times my problems here are rather that packs of animals grow to a threatening number -  and exactly such a problem emerged. A sow gave birth to a litter of piglets a couple of months ago, reports vary on their number. Some say three, others believe to have seen six. 
		Be as it may, I need you to put and end to them before the piglets grow to adult boars – I don’t need to tell you what a problem that would be. So what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_2">
		<text>Consider it done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_start_4">
		<text>That’s the spirit! They inhabit the small wood in the south east, behind the Witches Jelly anomaly. Here take these, they should come in handy! Come see me when they’re dead, I’ll have put some vodka put to the side for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_2_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_2_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to take on the boars?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_2_done_0">
		<text>The boars are no more.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_2_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have some booze and some food – on the house! And of course, a reward for your troubles. Have a rest and if you want more work – there is something urgent.</text>
	</string>
	
	
-- Quest 3 --

<string id="butcher_3_start_0">
		<text>You said there was an urgent task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_1">
		<text>Indeed. \n \n A group of snorks got lost and wandered over here from Agroprom. This happens sometimes, but in the past it always was one or two who found a way here - this time the reports talk about four! We can't let them dwell there, they pose too large a threat to the rookies. So what do you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_2">
		<text>They are as good as dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_start_4">
		<text>Alright! They took up residence south west from here,near the southern path to Agroprom... Here take this, they should come in handy! Come see me when they’re dead, we'll raise a glass to your deeds!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_3_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_3_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to take on the snorks?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_3_done_0">
		<text>The snorks are dead.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_3_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have a drink and some food. Here, have a smoke too. And of course, a reward for your troubles. Have a rest and come see me - I have a job for you concerning some lost cargo in the Swamp.</text>
	</string>	
	
-- Quest 4 --

<string id="butcher_4_start_0">
		<text>You said you wanted to talk to me about the snork problem?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_1">
		<text>Yes. \n \nYou see, this snork incursion worries me. It sometimes happened in the past, but never in these numbers! I've been thinking, probably the snork population in Agroprom grew too much and that's the reason why they come over in larger numbers now... Can you have a look and if my suspicion is right - cull them? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_2">
		<text>I will take a look.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_3">
		<text>I need some time to prepare.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_start_4">
		<text>Alright! Don't go alone, Ilya over there will accompany you - fear not he's a capable fighter. Travel over to Agroprom, if my suspicions are true, they should be somewhere between the southern and the northern path to Garbage. 
		There is a hill there, chances are good that's where you'll find them. Take this, you will need it. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_start_5">
		<text>No problem, come see me when you’re ready!</text>
	</string>		
	
	<string id="butcher_4_time_0">
		<text>Concerning that job.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_time_1">
		<text>Are you ready to cull the snork population?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="butcher_4_done_0">
		<text>The snorks are dead.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="butcher_4_done_1">
		<text>Well done! Here, have a drink and a bite. So tell me, how is the snork situation over there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_4_done_2">
		<text>You were right, we killed at least ten snorks! It was a massacre, I'm glad we made it out alive!</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="butcher_4_done_3">
		<text>Ten of these pieces of shit? Fuck... good that I send both you and Ilya to take care of the problem... We will have to keep an eye on this situation - this is very strange. 
		\n \nThanks for your help! Take a rest, and if you feel able to do some work again, go meet Aspirin, the Duty medic. He contacted me, seems they need some discrete help. </text>
	</string>			

---- Quest 5 ----
<string id="st_butcher_5_help_info">
		<text>Butcher: My friend, we need your urgent help. Ilya has been wounded in Agroprom and the other hunter, Orion, is missing in action. Please, go as soon as possible to Agroprom and find Ilya in the factory - he will be able to give you details.</text>
	</string>



<string id="butcher_5_start_0">
		<text>I got your message, what is going on?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_5_start_1">
		<text>Good that you're here - Ilya set off with another hunter, Orion, to find the cause of that Snork infestation. They were able to trace it back to the Agroprom Underground - 
		apparently something in there drives the Snorks out. Both of them undertook the mission to explore the Underground, but Ilya got wounded. They returned, but Orion set off again... young fool... that was yesterday and since then we haven't heard of him.
		I now this is a lot to ask, but can you go down there and check the situation out? We expect the worst, but we can't leave a brother behind. \n \nWould you be ready for such an undertaking?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_5_start_2">
		<text>Yes, of course, I'll head over there now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_5_start_3">
		<text>I don't know, that sounds very dangerous. I will have to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_5_start_4">
		<text>Great! Find Ilya, he is recovering from his wounds in the Agroprom Factory. And here, take this - you will need it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="butcher_5_start_5">
		<text>Understandable - but I'm afraid to insist on the urgency of this matter. Go find Ilya if you believe you're up to it.</text>
	</string>

<string id="ilya_muromets_3_0">
		<text>I got the message from Butcher, what is going on?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_3_1">
		<text>Good that you're here - we ran into some trouble and I'm wounded... I will make it, don't worry, but I'm incapacitated. I came here with another hunter - Orion, a young blood, to find the cause of that Snork infestation. We noticed that during the night, a lot of these bastards came pouring out of the Underground.
		There is something down there that drives them out - something nefarious... We went down there and it was brutal... our heads began to hurt and suddenly we were surrounded by Snorks and I got bitten in the arm and leg - luckily Orion was there to carry me out! But... that fool went back! I begged him to wait, but he was eager, how young people are!
		Shit, and now I haven't heard of him. My friend, please go down there and find him! I would like to come with you, but my leg won't carry me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_3_2">
		<text>Don't worry, I'll find Orion and bring him back here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_3_3">
		<text>I don't know, I don't think I'm ready to head down there yet!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_3_4">
		<text>I know I could count on you! And here, take this - I'm afraid you might need it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_3_5">
		<text>Understandable - but please hurry! And here, take this - if you're ready to go down there, I'm afraid you might need it.</text>
	</string>

<string id="ilya_muromets_4_0">
		<text>I found Orion...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_1">
		<text>I understand... What got him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_2">
		<text>I... I'm not sure. There is a huge room underneath, with somemachinery... and there was a Controller surrounded by Snorks and Burers who tried to protect him!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_3">
		<text>A Controller? You don't say... and he was friendly with the Snorks? I thought these mutants hated each other? Strange... I don't understand - if the Snorks were friendly to him, why did they flee the Underground?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_4">
		<text>I don't know man... but he had an army surrounding him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_5">
		<text>This place will never stop to confuse me. You know what, it's time for you to speak to Forester. After what you did here for us, you deserve to become part of our guild. I'm sure Butcher will vouch for you too! Go see him, and tell him what you saw down under.
		 I'll stay here for a while to recover and keep an eye on the situation. I'll find you later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_6">
		<text>Guild?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ilya_muromets_4_7">
		<text>Yeah man, a guild - or how Forester likes to call it, a Brotherhood. Go see him, he'll be able to explain all of this much better than I can.</text>
	</string>


--- Ilya Muromets ---
<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello Stalker, how can I help you?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, who are you?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_start_dialog_2">
		<text>I'm Ilya Muromets, but you can call me Ilya. I'm an old friend of Butcher. </text>
	</string>	

<string id="ilya_muromets_1_0">
		<text>Are you ready to go hunt some snorks?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_1_1">
		<text>Yeah, butcher told me to give you a hand. Lead the way, I'm behind you.</text>
	</string>

<string id="ilya_muromets_2_0">
		<text>That was brutal!</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="ilya_muromets_2_1">
		<text>Yeah, I never saw that many Snorks in one spot! This is very very strange - I will have to investigate. Thanks a lot for your help - you're quite good at this!</text>
	</string>

	
--- Hunter Duty ---	
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_0">
		<text>Butcher told me you might have a job for me.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_1">
		<text>Ah right! Thanks for coming.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_2">
		<text>No problem, how can I help?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_3">
		<text>Right. To make it short, the boys here have some trouble on their hands. Voronin recently went to a meeting with Sakharov and Kuznetsov to discuss some general matters. During that meeting, Sakharov asked Voronin to help them by clearing the Bloodsucker Village, a proposition Kuznetsov apparently laughed at, saying Duty wasn't able to manage that and he proposed the help of his soldiers instead.
			Voronin took that very badly, and started to boast about our boys capabilities. Nothing bad at defending the honour of our soldiers, but he lost any touch to reality and promised Sakharov to clear out the Bloodsucker Village for them. Problem is, he wants to do it overnight in order for the Ecologists to show up in the morning and find a safe village... Over fucking night! Can you imagine? 
		He wants to show off in front of the military, you understand - and this asshole doesn't care about the fact that some of them won't survive the night. \n \nOf course the boys are less than enthusiastic to lose their lifes for the General's ego, they are soldiers after all, no Spetsnaz.
		So they came to me, and I promised to see what I can do - I thought of Butcher and asked if he couldn't send us an experiencied hunter who is up to the job. Of course you need to be discrete, Vornonin can't know anything about this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_4">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_5">
		<text>Clearing out the Bloodsucker Village during night? That's suicide!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_6">
		<text>"We are not to reason why, we are but to do and die." Orders are orders, I don't condone insubordination!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_7">
		<text>I'm glad to hear that, it is always nice to talk to professionals. Of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. So you're in?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_8">
		<text>Yes it's tough, but think about it - if someone can do it, it's certainly you! Butcher told me about your skills hunting mutants - that's more than I can say about our boys. Of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. Will you help us? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_9">
		<text>I understand the need for a soldier to follow orders of his superiors, but this is objectively not a sane mission! These are actual people being send for a mission they haven't trained for! Think of it! You on the other hand have experience in these matters, 
		at least Butcher told me that you are skilled in hunting mutants. And of course we don't expect you doing it for free, the boys will pitch in to reward you for your help! 
		They even managed to bribe Mangun to give them a nightvision device - so you won't have to go in blind like a mole. So you're in?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_10">
		<text>Alright, I will do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_11">
		<text>I can do it, but I want Voronin to know it was me!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_12">
		<text>I need some time to think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_13">
		<text>No way, they can do it themselves!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_14">
		<text>God bless you. Come see me the night you want to do it, I'll give you the nightvision device and warn the boys they should pretend to leave for the raid.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_15">
		<text>That's not possible, Voronin wants it to be the guys designated by him. Can you not do it for them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_16">
		<text>Alright, but please don't take too long, Voronin grows impatient.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_17">
		<text>Are you sure? Think about it, the guys would really appreciate it!</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_time_0">
		<text>About the Bloodsucker Village.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_time_1">
		<text>Yeah? Are you up to it?</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_1">
		<text>Yeah? Did you change your mind?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_13">
		<text>I decided, I will certainly not do it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_no_17">
		<text>*Sigh* A shame, I had high hopes for you, but alright... I'll ask Butcher if he can send me someone else...</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_2">
		<text>I am ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_3">

		<text>I am not ready yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_5">
		<text>Good to hear that, come see me this night before you set off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_6">
		<text>Perfect. Here is your nightvision device - I also packed some batteries so that you won't find yourself in the middle of night without juice. Take these medics too, hopefully you won't need them, but better safe than sorry.
		You have to be back in six hours, before the Ecologists will set off! Good hunting Stalker, and thanks for helping us out!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_yes_7">
		<text>Alright, come see me when you are.</text>
	</string>	
	
<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_1_0">
		<text>The job is done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_1_1">
		<text>Excellent work! I knew you would pull through!</text>
	</string>	

<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_2_0">
		<text>I'm sorry, I couldn't get the job done in time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_2_1">
		<text>Don't worry Stalker! We will get some scolding from Voronin, but at least no life is lost.</text>

<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_0">
		<text>What happened in the Bloodsucker Village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_1">
		<text>You ratted us out, that's what happened. Why?</text>

		<text>I believe in following orders.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_3">
		<text>I wanted to see what would happen.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_4">
		<text>I did it for the money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_5">
		<text>You're an asshole. You could simply have ignored this and we would have hired someone else - instead three of our boys are dead and Artyom is in a critical condition.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_6">
		<text>You wanted to see what would happen? Three dead - one wounded - that's what would happen! You're an asshole - get lost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_0_snitch_7">
		<text>For the money? You're an asshole - your greed cost the life of our boys!</text>

<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_about_artyom_0">
		<text>What happened to the guy on the floor?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_about_artyom_1">
		<text>Artyom - a collateral of your ratting. Artyom is the only survivor - he managed to run away when everything went to shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_about_artyom_2">
		<text>Will he make it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_about_artyom_3">
		<text>Probably yeah, I managed to stabilize him. But he still is in great pain and he seems to be badly traumatized - he has panic fits and I have to give him Morphine in order to calm him down.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_about_artyom_4">
		<text>I'm sorry for what happened.</text>

		<text>Then stop wasting my time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_6">
		<text>They are afraid to do it - they say that they are not trained for such a night mission.</text>

		<text>What? Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_10">
		<text>They were too afraid to do it - they said that they are not trained for such a night mission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_snitch_11">

<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_0">
		<text>You wanted to see me?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_1">
		<text>Yes... I'm afraid that the mission failed. Of the four men I send only one made it back - badly wounded and out of his mind. 
				We barely got anything out of him, but it seems that it went to shit the moment they set foot into that Village.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_2">
		<text>What happened?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_3">
		<text>Artyom wasn't able to give a full report...  from what I understood, they didn’t follow protocol and separated which resulted in a mission failure. 
		He's with Aspirin at the moment, maybe you can get something out of him. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_4">
		<text>What do you want me to do about the situation?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_5">
		<text>No one can know about this failure and my men refuse to go back to that Village during night. 
			I need someone to sneak into the village during night and swap the fallen men's Duty patch with Mercenary ones... </text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_6">
		<text>What? Are you fucking kidding me?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_7">
		<text>Understandable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_8">
		<text>Not at all, this is vital for the reputation of Duty - we can not be allowed to show weakness!</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_9">
		<text>I'm glad that we are on the same page - the reputation of Duty is after all paramount.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_10">
		<text>Can you not simply recover their bodies?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_11">
		<text>Out of question! That would draw too much attention to the failure - I cannot allow it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_111">
		<text>But these man died in the line of duty! You have to recover them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_112">
		<text>These men knew for what they signed up. Besides, the reputation of Duty is larger than the memory of a few men.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_12">
		<text>Why Mercenary patches?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_13">
		<text>Isn't it obvious? To make it look as if some Mercenaries dressed as Duty soldiers in order to bypass Rostok without unnecessary attention, but got caught in the Bloodsucker Village. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_14">
		<text>Alright, I will help you clean up the evidence.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="voronin_bloodsucker_botched_15">
		<text>I have to think about it.</text>

		<text>You said you have a job offer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_1">
		<text>Yes - the boys want to get vengeance on these Bloodsuckers and considering that you have...

	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_2">
		<text>So you're not taking it badly that I told Voronin and accepted his job?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_3">
		<text>Well... obviously that was not very cool of you - we could have hired someone else who would have done it instead of you.
	But... I - We understand that the Zone is not very conductive for morals and that people like you are here for... their personal gains.
	Water under the Bridge, you didn't kill Sasha, Sergey and Vadim, these fucking Bloodsuckers did it... now we would like to hire you for payback. 
	A lot of money Stalker, the boys didn't clutch their wallets in order to get payback.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_medic_hunter_3_7">
		<text>No night raid needed Stalker, the plan is quite different. We bought all the explosives we could get our hands on, and we will set them up in different locations of the village showing Bloodsucker activity.
		When they creep out during the night, we will blow them up like firework!</text>

	</string>	
	<string id="forester_mutanthammer_1">
		<text>Ah yes, the Mutanthammer. I remember this gun, it was me who modified it! 
			Mainly I fluted the barrel and replaced some of it's components with a lighter material to cut off some weight. Of course it also comes with a downside - the gun will wear faster than a standard Saiga.
			Took me some time, but I'm really proud of it. So you're the new owner - I hope it will serve you well! Here, let me clean it for you and repair it in order to make it pristine again. </text>

<string id="forester_legendary_0_0">
		<text>What's the story behind that Bloodsucker trophy?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_1">
		<text>Oh that's Moloch - the brother of Vlad and Drakul.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_2">
		<text>Moloch? Vlad? Drakul? Since when do mutants have names?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_3">
		<text>Since I gave a name to these mutants. Of course they are not any Bloodsuckers - they are very ancient beings... they've been around since the earlier days of the Zone - and around here, being old means something.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_04">
		<text>Vlad and Drakul? That doesn't sound very original for Bloodsuckers?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_05">
		<text>I don't care if it's original, what matters to me is that it suits them. Besides, if you believe you're more creative - find a mutant deserving a name and prove it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_4">
		<text>Brothers? How do you know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_5">
		<text>I don't know - but for me they are brothers. I met them together - here in this forest. The first Bloodsuckers I've ever seen, I didn't know that such devils could even exist... but they do...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_6">
		<text>What is the story behind them?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_7">
		<text>Where to begin? From where they came - I don't know... But I still remember the first time I met them. It was not long after the second great explosion, the one which created this hell. 
			I picked up a distress radio call of survivors - a military scout squad which got lost in the Zaton swamps. Apparently their commander walked into a Vortex and with him their only map got shredded. 
			Imagine giving only one map for a whole squad - but it seems some things didn't change since the old days. Nevertheless, I found the two survivors and promised to lead them back to their headquarters - back in the days the Military still had a presence in the Army Warehouses.
			We reached this forest at dusk - I wanted to overnight at this complex, but these boys were eager to rejoin their base. Nowadays, crossing the forest at night would mean certain death, but you know back then most of these mutants were quite rare and didn't yet reach the southern parts of the Zone. 
			So we made a compromise - we were to take a rest and have something to eat and continue our journey after having warmed our bellies with food and our spirit with vodka. We entered the forest to gather some firewood and cooked some meat on a clearing. I don't know what attracted them - the smell of food or maybe the laughter...
			I left the fireplace to take a piss while the two soldiers continued fooling around. When returned to the fire I saw one of them lying on the ground - hissing from laughter I thought... it was only when I stood next to him that I noticed the blood gurgling out of his throat. I looked up - the other stood there with wide eyes and behind him...
			I don't know which of the brothers it was, but that was the first Bloodsucker I saw in my life. I didn't understand - I simply froze. That's when I felt tentacles grapling around my neck - strong and hot was that grip! I wasn't thinking - I grabbed a piece of burning wood and struck behind me! 
			The Bloodsucker immediately let go of me, and I scrambled off, running for my life! That's how I met Moloch, Vlad and Drakul! 
		</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_8">
		<text>Damn... but you managed to shoot Moloch? How did that happen?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_9">
		<text>I met the brothers many times since then! At first I shunned that forest, until I noticed that they are night creatures. I started to track them, gather informations on this new danger lurking in my wood. I tried to lay traps - the first worked but I wasn't able to capitalise on it, but the brothers also learned and started to avoid them.
			Sometimes I managed to wound one - sometimes they managed to wound me. I tried to find their lair by following their foodsteps - to no avail, I never found the exact location. This continued until one day, some bandits tried to jump me. They tried to extort me - I refused. It escalated and they ended up dead - except one! He was wounded and out cold - bleeding to death. 
			So I decided not to let a good corpse go to waste and I carried him into the forest as bait. I tied him to a tree and waited in ambush for the brothers. And sure enough they came - surrounding that poor fellow. Yes, it was not right for me to do that to a fellow man - to expose him to such horros without giving him a fighting chance... But back then I thought it was a good idea.
			While they were gulping on their easy prey, I took aim and patiently waiting for my shot. And I shot - it went right through Moloch's heart. Vlad and Drakul screached up in fright and took off - and I took my trophy. \n \n
			Since then I never saw them again, they retreated deep into the forest and rarely come out anymore - they let most of their hunting be done by their conspecifics.</text>

	<string id="forester_legendary_0_12">
		<text>Then you are a fool! They mean certain death - don't be so rash as to believe you'll be able to master them!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_13">
		<text>They are mutants, Forester, you don't honestly believe they stopped killing, do you? They have to be destroyed - especially if they are as dangerous as you say!</text>

	<string id="forester_legendary_0_14">
		<text>You're right - patience is in order. We have to wait for an opportune moment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_15">
		<text>Of course I don't believe they stopped murdering - but it's not your duty putting an end to them! Maybe I wasn't clear enough - they are not your normal Bloodsuckers, they are much worse. They are like a force of nature - we have to live with them.</text>

	<string id="forester_legendary_0_16">

	<string id="forester_legendary_0_17">
		<text>I know - you're valant and your skills are great! But this is an order of magnitude which you haven't faced yet - you're overestimating your own strenght - you're rash and want to hurry and this makes you prone to mistakes. Don't ask of me to be guilty of your death - keep your strenght for other mutants, don't waste away your life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_0_18">

	<string id="forester_legendary_0_19">
		<text>Aah, young people... so overconfident. You don't understand - you will not face them alone, but also their brethren! \n \n... \n \nBut I can see it in your eyes, you're determined.
		Tell you what, bring me the hearts of ten Bloodsuckers, and I'll tell you how to find them... at least you will have experience facing these devils... </text>

<string id="forester_legendary_1_0">

	<string id="forester_legendary_1_1">

	<string id="forester_legendary_1_2">
		<text>I want to hunt them.</text>

		<text>Tell me the story again how you first met them.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Tell me the story again how you shot Moloch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_1_5">
		<text>It was not long after the second great explosion, the one which created this hell. 
			I picked up a distress radio call of survivors - a military scout squad which got lost in the Zaton swamps. Apparently their commander walked into a Vortex and with him their only map got shredded. 
			Imagine giving only one map for a whole squad - but it seems some things didn't change since the old days. Nevertheless, I found the two survivors and promised to lead them back to their headquarters - back in the days the Military still had a presence in the Army Warehouses.
			We reached this forest at dusk - I wanted to overnight at this complex, but these boys were eager to rejoin their base. Nowadays, crossing the forest at night would mean certain death, but you know back then most of these mutants were quite rare and didn't yet reach the southern parts of the Zone. 
			So we made a compromise - we were to take a rest and have something to eat and continue our journey after having warmed our bellies with food and our spirit with vodka. We entered the forest to gather some firewood and cooked some meat on a clearing. I don't know what attracted them - the smell of food or maybe the laughter...
			I left the fireplace to take a piss while the two soldiers continued fooling around. When returned to the fire I saw one of them lying on the ground - hissing from laughter I thought... it was only when I stood next to him that I noticed the blood gurgling out of his throat. I looked up - the other stood there with wide eyes and behind him...
			I don't know which of the brothers it was, but that was the first Bloodsucker I saw in my life. I didn't understand - I simply froze. That's when I felt tentacles grapling around my neck - strong and hot was that grip! I wasn't thinking - I grabbed a piece of burning wood and struck behind me! 
			The Bloodsucker immediately let go of me, and I scrambled off, running for my life! That's how I met Moloch, Vlad and Drakul!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_1_6">
		<text>I started to track the brothers, gather informations on this new danger lurking in my wood. I tried to lay traps - the first worked but I wasn't able to capitalise on it, but the brothers also learned and started to avoid them.
			Sometimes I managed to wound one - sometimes they managed to wound me. I tried to find their lair by following their foodsteps - to no avail, I never found the exact location. This continued until one day, some bandits tried to jump me. They tried to extort me - I refused. It escalated and they ended up dead - except one! He was wounded and out cold - bleeding to death. 
			So I decided not to let a good corpse go to waste and I carried him into the forest as bait. I tied him to a tree and waited in ambush for the brothers. And sure enough they came - surrounding that poor fellow. Yes, it was not right for me to do that to a fellow man - to expose him to such horros without giving him a fighting chance... But back then I thought it was a good idea.
			While they were gulping on their easy prey, I took aim and patiently waiting for my shot. And I shot - it went right through Moloch's heart. Vlad and Drakul screached up in fright and took off - and I took my trophy.</text>

		<text>[Bloodsucker Hearts] I brought proof that I'm able to hunt Bloodsuckers.</text>

	<string id="forester_legendary_1_9">
		<text>Impressive... I'm reluctant to tell you this, but I believe a promise is a promise... So listen carefully - their lair is deep in the forest to the east of here - in the proximity of an old soviet tank. Where exactly - I don't know but that doesn't matter.
			You will have to bait them out, and I believe to know how to do it but you won't like it... You will have to adone my old overcoat - it's the one I had while I was hunting them in the old days, it will have my smell and they will believe that it's me who dares to meet them. 
			It's old - so don't expect good protection... I did some repairs and added two fasteners so you can use two attachments - so choose wisely! And of course you will have to do it during the night, when they feel confident in the protection the dark provides - else they will not dare to affront "me"...

<string id="forester_legendary_2_0">
		<text>About the hunt for Vlad and Drakul. </text>

	<string id="forester_legendary_2_5">
		<text>Can you tell me about the plan again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_2_6">
		<text>Sure, listen carefully: You will have to do it during the night, when they feel confident in the protection the dark provides. Their lair is deep in the forest to the east of here - in the proximity of an old soviet tank. Where exactly - I don't know but that doesn't matter.
			You will have to bait them out, and I believe to know how to do it but you won't like it... You will have to adone my old overcoat - it's the one I had while I was hunting them in the old days, it will have my smell and they will believe that it's me who dares to meet them. 
			It's old - so don't expect good protection... I did some repairs and added two fasteners so you can use two attachments - so choose wisely! And I have the strong suspicion that you will not only have to face them, but their brethren too!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_2_7">
		<text>Alright, I see you're adamant. Here is the coat - you will not have to wear it on your way there, but try to put it on shortly before reaching the tank. Do you remember the way? It's deep in the forest, 
		east of here, but to reach it you have to pass through an old mine tunnel a bit to the south. After passing it you turn north again an you walk for quite some time. The tank is hidden by a small hill - ready yourself there and approach the tank carefully.
		I'm not sure how they will react, but maybe they will send some of their brethren first to tire you out. Remember - you have to do it by night! If the sun rises, they will retreat. You will need to set out shortly after sunset...\n \nNow good luck young Stalker - may the night be in your favour.</text>
	</string>
<string id="forester_legendary_2_8">
		<text>Very good. Come see me after shortly after sunset - I'll give you the coat then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_2_9">
		<text>No problem - you know you don't have to do this. Let's talk about something else.</text>
	</string>	

<string id="forester_legendary_3_0">
		<text>Are there other named mutants?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_1">
		<text>Yes there are... there is the Calydonian Boar. Butcher named him, the scourge of any hunter in the Great Swamp region. Then there is Moby Dick - the white Pseudogiant. Gonta is intimately acquainted to him. Finally there is Chyort - the Chimera male.
			Evasive fucker - the only known survivor is Trapper.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_2">
		<text>Tell me more about the Calydonian Boar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_3">
		<text>Tell me more about Moby Dick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_4">
		<text>Tell me more about Chyort.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_5">
		<text>Thank you for these informations.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_6">
		<text>He's the patron saint of any boar in the Great Swamp - many hunters are known to have died by his tusks when they hunted for his brethren. His hide is said to be as thick as scales of Zmei Gorynich. Butcher tried to hunt him in the past - according to him he met that beast twice - and twice that boar shrugged off a shotgun blast to the flank!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_7">
		<text>Moby Dick - Gonta's nemesis. He carries that name because he's large as a whale - and an albino! That Pseudogiant killed his childhood friend, and since then Gonta is hunting him, and for years he eluded his vengeance. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_8">
		<text>Yes, Chyort... the devil himself. They say one strike would be enough to even cleave Sidorovich in half! Not that I ever met Sidorovich, but according to the rumors, it sounds like quite a feat! No one knows where his lair is, but he sometimes wanders into different regions to either eat or procreate! 
		Trapper says that the stronger Chimeras are his offspring - considering the amount of strong chimeras, you can imagine that Chyort's hunger for flesh is only surpassed by his lust.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_3_10">
		<text>No problem, I hope this will serve as a cautionary tale - don't fuck with these mutants!</text>
	</string>
	
<string id="forester_legendary_4_0">
		<text>I didn't manage to kill the Bloodsucker in time - dawn was upon me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="forester_legendary_4_1">
		<text>Don't worry young Stalker, the most important is that you're still alive! You will have another chance another night. Come see me if you wish to give it another shot.</text>
	</string>	
	
<string id="forester_legendary_5_0">

		I would need two fracture hands, one Bloodsucker heart and a sample from a Pseudogiant, doesn't matter  what, a hand, an eye, it's hide. Bring it to me and I'll compensate you for your troubles. Let's say... 20.000 for everything?</text>

		<text>Yes, the Partially Satisfied Man - the necessary intermediary to the Fully Satisfied Man! Ah, imagine a man who is able to satisfy all his needs by himself!

	</string>
	<string id="vybegallo_3_15">
		<text>Difficult to say, I never saw him after he hatched... He should probably resemble me, as he has part of my DNA? But these are details mon cher, don't bother about it!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="vybegallo_3_17">
		<text>Mon cher, it's with a heavy heart that I have to ask you to liquidate my experiment. 
			What a shame, what a loss for science! But we cannot allow him to run off - that would only attract unnecessary attention to my experiments!
			You wouldn't believe how reactionary some of my collegues are. But at least I should be able to gather his remains in order to conduct further experiments - progress cannot be stopped, n'est-ce pas mon cher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vybegallo_3_18">
		<text>Where can I find "him"?</text>

	</string>

		<text>Ah very interesting, so the Pseudogiant DNA took the overhand? This is extraordinary! It was only supposed to improve his resilience in this climate, but the Pseudogiant took completely over?</text>

	<string id="vybegallo_5_4">
		<text>What the fuck are you doing? There are enough dangers in the Zone - why are you creating new ones?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vybegallo_5_5">
		<text>Mon cher, this is scientific progress! Some risks have to be taken! Marie Curie took risks for humankind - Yuri Gagarin too! The list is long, mon cher! Now we know more, and we won't repeat the mistakes! Consider it a scientific success!
			But I see that you're new to the scientific method - and I believe that I owe you a reward. Take this! I... borrowed it from the institute after a disagreement. It's a prototype - but I believe it should be quite useful to... more practical oriented people. Thank you very much mon cher!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="vybegallo_5_6">
		<text>Yes, now please give me the money.</text>
	</string>

		<text>He asked me to help him with his science experiment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_7">
		<text>He asked you for help? No offence, but you don’t look like a lab assistant. Why would Vybegallo need a Stalker?</text>

		<text>He asked me to find some artifact for him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_9">
		<text>An artifact? This seems unusual for him, but maybe he finally found a normal research topic…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_10">
		<text>He asked me to find some mutant parts for him.</text>

		<text>What... what kind of mutant parts?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Fracture, Bloodsucker and Pseudogiant parts. Why?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_11">
		<text>What? This is horrible!!! \n \n… \n \nYou see, years ago Vybegallo got into his head to create the “ideal man” – or the “fully satisfied man” as he calls it, but his experiments were one disaster after another. I'm not talking about the ethical aspects, my god, although they are bad enough. His first version, the fully unsatisfied man, was a miserable creature who dwindled away under our very eyes... But Vybegallo was not discouraged and continued his experiments.
		\n \nAfter one especially egregious attempt which nearly cost the life of half his department, his research institute kicked him out. But Vybegallo somehow managed to pull some strings and wound up here! I’m afraid he didn’t give up on this experiment… Who knows what he will unleash?  \n \nI implore you, don’t help him out! \n \n No this is not enough, here take this order to him and make him understand that he has to cease any dangerous experiments immediately. I don’t know how much he promised you, I can’t put much on the table at the moment, but I will find some reward. \n\nWill you help us out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_start_12">
		<text>Sure, I will deliver the letter and not help him out any further.</text>

	<string id="sakharov_vybegallo_2_7">
		<text>To be honest, no. The largest traders will maybe refrein from doing business with him, but individual Stalkers don't give a shit about sanctions. But we have to do something, and it will make at least some people think twice about working with him.</text>

		I ask you - no I insist: kill Vybegallo. He cannot continue doing his experiments. \n \nI understand that you are a Stalker and won't do it for free. I can mobilise some funds for this and let go of some highly sofisticated devices. So what do you say?</text>

	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_2">
		<text>What happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_3">
		<text>The bandits recently reinforced that crossing and are asking for quite a high bribe to let people pass – very bad for business. </text>

		<text>An assault? What’s the plan?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_5">
		<text>We will effectuate a pincer movement. Cold send a squad over to help out, under the leadership of a certain “Castor”, they should arrive soon at the northern farm. 
		My team will gather at the mill under the leadership of Pollux. \n\nYou will take on the role of messenger – you’ll first need to bypass the railway bridge to make contact with Castor and check if they are ready for the assault. 
		If they are ready, you return to the Mill where Castor will wait. If everyone is in place, tell Castor that the assault can begin. \n\nAny questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_6">
		<text>Why do I need to make contact in person. Can’t we use the PDA messenger to communicate with the Clear Sky squad?</text>

	<string id="sidorovich_railway_1_7">
		<text>Are you aware that to render PDA communication secure is a complicated procedure? You would have to exchange encryption and decryption keys manually - a huge hazzle.

	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_13">
		<text>Thanks. So tell me, what happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_14">
		<text>You won't believe it! Yesterday I was drinking with the boys and we played some cards. My luck turned bad and I lost all my money to Andrey.
	So, this morning I set out in order to make my money back - I figured if I managed to hunt some Flesh or Boars, I could sell their parts for some good money. I set off a bit later int the morning, but
	the sun was heavy, so I decided to take a short rest in the shadow of the old Church: I had a few bites and some sips of Vodka - to fight my headache, you understand?
	Suddenly I heard some guys talking behind the wall,  what a foul language, you can't imagine! Fuck, I thought, tongues like this only grow on these Renegade Gopniks,
	so I took my feet into my hands and ran away to the north. Luckily they didn't see me, so my skin was safe... might have forgotten my bottle though now that I think of it.
	Fuck it! I bypassed the cemetery and made my way to the pond -
	I figured that maybe I might catch some of these pigs watering. Aah, my friend, my intuition was right, there were two pigs taking a rest on the shore. 
	I snuck up and BAM - shot and missed. My hands were probably still shaky from yesterday evening... doesn't matter! The two pigs squeal up, taking off in the direction of the burned farmstead. 
	I lunch myself in pursuit, but I gave those two such a fright that one run straight into the flame anomaly! The pillar engulfed him immediatly, roasting him on the spot.
	I cursed the heavens, impossible to make money of that pile of ashes now I thought. But then I noticed it... the pig probably kicked a Flame while running through the anomaly,
	and the artifact landed outside, ripe for the taking! Can you imagine it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_15">
		<text>Incredible! What luck!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_16">
		<text>Indeed, indeed! Let's have a drink to that!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_17">
		<text>Let's drink!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_18">
		<text>Ah my friend, I quite enjoy drinking with you! Let's have another one, to friendship!</text>

	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_19">
		<text>I like drinking with you too! To friendship!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sasha_tolstoy_2_20">
		<text>Here my friend, have a bite.</text>

	</string>	
	<string id="fanatic_north_0_6">
		<text>Good that you mention the training, I've got a favor to ask of you. 
			You see, I try to help the rookies around here out and provide them with some of the basic tools to survive in this environment - you know, like I helped you... 
			The problem is, these tools are expensive - I try to pay for it out of my own pocket, but Sidorovich doesn't pay that well to guard this village and he says it's against his philosophy to give hand-outs... so I have to resort to donations. 
			Some of my former pupils kick back some money if they are able to - the problem is, they are few in number as they either die or got generosity sucked out of them by the Zone. \n \n Do you think you could make a small donations in order to help the future generation to get on their feet?</text>
